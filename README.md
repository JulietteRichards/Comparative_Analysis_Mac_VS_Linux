# Comparative Analysis of Mac and Linux  

This repository contains my in-depth Comparative Analysis of Mac and Linux, focusing on:  
- Core components (kernel architecture, file systems, package management).  
- Security features (user account control, encryption, firewall capabilities).  
- User support practices (official support, community forums, and documentation).  

This paper was written as part of my Computer Science studies at Capella University.
